╰┈➤My sense of humor is very weird and wacky, if I make you uncomfortable do not be afraid to tell me!!!

╰┈➤Do NOT interact if you're looking to be with someone, I am a minor, I'm not interested and it's weird to creep on someone in a literal pony game in a server for M I N O R S

╰┈➤I do not tolerate racism, sexism, homophobia, pedophilia and zoophilia. If you are involved in even one of these groups do not talk to me. If I do find out you will be blocked.

„ÄÉ‚ú¶ ‚îÜ I'm open to interactions, but most of the time I'm comfortable with my friends!

„ÄÉ‚ú¶ ‚îÜ If I move away from you, take it as I sign I do not want to be touched or if I have DNTUF in my name. Otherwise, C+H if you want!

„ÄÉ‚ú¶ ‚îÜ I'm socially awkward when meeting new people ^-^

„ÄÉ‚ú¶ ‚îÜ Sometimes I can switch up really quickly, I can go from yapping to silently sitting behind you **[if we are friends!]** - I do this when I'm tired, when I just want to watch what happens, when I'm offtab or have no idea on what to say.

„ÄÉ‚ú¶ ‚îÜ Speaking of having no idea on what to say, sometimes I just put random letters in the chat when I have no clue on what to respond with. 

„ÄÉ‚ú¶ ‚îÜ Feel free to compliment my skin if you want! Crowns are appreciated ^^ Just please don't make it sexual, especially if you're a stranger.
